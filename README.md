### **This is the machine learning based project aims to conduct fraud detection**

1. The model result are in the .ppt file and you can find EDA and visualization in the jupyter notebook
2. This project also support for the online deployment, please run the shell script and provide the setting file
3. The model used is LR as baseline model. Bagging and Boosting are the high level model

### **Challenge**

1. Basically all fradu detection projects are concerned about imbalance learning problem

2. Category variable distance: Cannot use Label Encoder

3. Time Limit when map IP to country.

### **Solution**
1. I provide three ways
- Oversampling
- Undersampling
- SMOTE

2. use dependency encoding instead

3. use two pointer algorithm
